# TEAM UK Data Visualisation Dashboard

This website presents the results of the UK Low Energy Demand project for the transport sector, using the Transport Energy Air pollution Model (TEAM) modelling framework.

## Goals

The goal of this project was to contribute to the evidence base supporting the clean transition in the UK transport sector. We asked how low can we go in terms of reducing transport energy demand. Working with over 100 expert stakeholders from UK government, academia, NGOs and the private sector, we developed a set of integrated scenarios for the future of the UK's transport sector to advance strategic transport, energy & environment modelling to support informed policy-making in securing the UK's long-term prosperity, sustainability and quality of life.

The long-term aim of TEAM-UK is to provide a modelling framework for the country that enables interested stakeholders to test out potential policy actions, strategies and futures in the evolution of the UK's transport-energy system.
